# HyDE with Query-based Re-ranking
> __Summary of "Retrieval Augmented Generation with Hypothetical Document Embedding and Query-based Re-ranking"__

# 1. Introduction
- __HyDE (Hypothesis Document Embeddings)__ is a method that searches for knowledge from a database by using the average embeddings of a query and multiple hypotheses generated by an LLM. It has shown retrieval performance comparable to a fine-tuned retriever even without fine-tuning for semantic search.
- However, the HyDE has the limitation that it places the query on the same level as the ‘fake’ hypotheses generated by the LLM, even though the query contains the information the user wants. To compensate for the shorcomings of this HyDE, we propose a query-based re-ranking methodology.

# 2. Methodology
- This query-based re-ranking is simple: candidates are extracted using hypotheses excluding the query, and their ranks are reordered based on the similarity between the query and the sentences they contain. Through this re-ranking process, candidates with sentences that have the greatest similarity to the query are given higher scores.
